      "text": "Hello, Kapil. I'm sorry. I missed, the talk earlier. I got a little late, but, this question may be arising from a completely diluted line. But, here it is. I, when I read your, articles, discourses, and you talked about mind, like, meditativeness, with regard to, as opposed to meditation. It looks like, at the beginning, I couldn't really understand, like, the disc discourse of what you meant, but, as more more I became available, to really immersing myself in whatever I do or be disciplined in the way I talk or walk, it feels that my understanding of it, of meditativeness, increases, and it's like a positive feedback loop. And, I don't know if meditativeness and understanding it better and, like, is that this is So as you are explaining it, what you're basically saying, and it is correct, is that the meditativeness arises. And the reason that it arises is because it has a chance to arise. And the reason that it has a chance to is we don't fall under the trap of trying to obtain it through prescriptions and austerity, such as meditation. Meditation is a force. Meditation is a dead end, and meditation does not lead to meditating. But as you've discovered, meditative is something that arise because it was given was given the chance to arrive because of lack of falling in the trap of two some. Right. Right. May I ask you another quick follow-up question? Okay. Okay. So maybe that's a little bit intellectual, but I just showed understanding and being available to to that, to meditativeness and understanding. Is that the same as understanding one's nature or wisdom, or is it coming I mean, I I don't wanna say which would come first, which one later because that makes it little little academic. But It's not a it's not a question that's answerable because as you said, it is intellectual. It becomes conceptual. All I can tell you is if a person is devoted to truth, if if within the person, they're genuinely more of a devotion to truth than their prescriptions, then that person will change. K. Thank you. Hello, Sidha.",

      "text": "I have a question. So I was reading some articles on your website, and this particular article about the didacticism, how it destroys. So you explained how, you know, some truth is taken to the lab and, like, you know, phonics and all the vocabulary that is developed out of it. Basically, it's like a trap, if I understood that correctly. But my question is, not just you, but, you know, a lot of other spiritual and other kind of leaders that, you know, a lot of people follow, including myself. A lot of times, it's so difficult to understand, like, I mean, especially for people, like, who, you know I I don't know. I mean, it it is so difficult to understand with a lot of different words, you know, put in a different way. So isn't it better to just kinda simplify how all these messages are delivered so that it actually gets to more people around the world? Dumbing it down makes people dumb, and those who are dumb and need things dumbed down will never get it anymore. But then those who give those who give to I'm not interested in arguing with. I have one response to and those who dumb it down for you you're asking again. Those who dumb it down for the masses. They deserve the masses, and the masses deserve that because they have no truth to Hi, Kapil.",

Is that sort of saying that there's even though we've deviated so far that that this dimension of living is our human birthright, so to speak? There are many things that are the human birthright, but there is the human birthright, and then there is the practicality. So one's potential, no matter how grand it may be, what a person actually lives and tastes, experience is only that which is practically possible, not practically not practically possible on an ultimate intention, on an ultimate level, but practically possible on what he actually will receive or experience in this lifetime. And that practical possibility, for the vast majority of human is to live a traditional life of illusion and chasing. That is the way that it always has been, and that is the way it will always be, and there is nothing to change that. Eight each human being is unique in themselves. The own only the individuals who survives survive in the sense of even taste, their ultimate human potential, are the ones who have that DNA to, as I mentioned, turn their back on their back on the world, seek the truth, move away from prescription, and that is an indescribably low number or small Hi, Kabil.",

That said, your craft is one that borders on art. Right? You're an orator. You're you're a writer. You're a public speaker. And we often talk about art and artistry and craftsmanship when it comes to the pursuit of the truth. Yet, I came into your work set of performance from the perspective of business and sport. I was a competitive athlete, and I work in finance and trading. And I'm sort of wanting, and I'm sure many of the people in the audience are wanting for an equivalent example of someone dedicated to the truth. But working in what I am struggling with might just be society created career paths or false objectives of success. Because every time I ask myself, what am I not understanding about an achievement in finance, trading, performance, business, I come to the conclusion that all these things are empty chases. And I tried to sort of ask this last time I was up, which is if the question is false to begin with, is there no such thing as a truthful answer? But I'm just curious if you have any guidance on those of us that have you as a model for truth, have artists as models for truth, but we're trying to apply this to, you know, business, finance, something more analytical like that. Well, as Do you have any guidance? I think that you've you've answered your own question because you have just stated that you that business, finance, and all of these things are empty in themselves. Mhmm. So at the end of the day, everything is empty. Nothing has any meaning, but it is precisely the the devotion that one brings to something that gives it some relevance in someone's life. But as for the the thing itself, the the the thing itself has nothing. Mhmm. So the trouble is that human beings live in the society. And while living does not necessarily have to create problem, the trouble is that they believe society. They believe in they believe in society, even the principle, and they believe in their culture, their subdomain of business and sport, whatever it may be. They believe in those things, and they listen to the prevailing dogma of those, and they buy into those things. And, therefore, they are blindfolded, and they are assaulted, and they live a life of torture because not because they did something wrong, but that is the natural result of buying into something that fundamentally, in all forms of culture, in all forms of society, in all forms of people, in all forms of the world, in all forms of institution, in all forms of groups, are all lies. And now that does not mean that you should not listen. There is no shouldn't it simply means that if one subscribes to lies, what can he realistically expect besides frustration and disappointment?

There are no different dimensions. There's a different dimension. I can't. What what are you what what are you really You're asking for a dictionary different definition. What are you really asking? Dictionary. For example, like, I've been going through Bhagavad Gita. I was reading Bhagavad Gita as a books for, like, a spiritual knowledge and trying to follow that. So I got it's like, I the time came first time. So so why so why are you so why are you trying to follow that? No. I want to know about, dimension, how you're gonna define. No. No. Why why are you trying to follow why are you trying to follow the Gita? Because Gita is a because before we have to be disciple, before then, we want to become a guru. First, we have to become disciple. That's why I'm taking as a first as a knowledge, and then I will apply, and then I will get a So, you know, I'm not I'm not really sure what can be said to you because you're you're basically like a a a universe student, but your university is spirituality. You're you're fed in in your traditions with all this this hierarchical nonsense. Your traditions are nonsense. They had no meaning. To become a disciple then become a guru, it's all just putting on a bunch of robes and talking nonsense to in fact, what your traditions are actually are part of the reason why everyone's illusioned because you sprinkle a bunch of prescriptions upon them and do this and do this and om sha d'om. It's all nonsense. It's it's complete garbage. There is not there's not there's there is I'm not interested in arguing with you. I'm just telling you it's just the way it is.

It is all didacticism, and you can follow the you can follow the Gita until you're 495 years old, and that won't do anything for you.

So their level of being fooled is no different by meditation or spirituality than your level of being fooled. It's terms such as neuroplasticity. What's the difference? Everyone's being fooled. Can I ask a follow-up? You can ask a follow-up, but you haven't understood the answer to the first one yet. No. No. I I don't think you have. You believe that you know something about the brain, and the reason that you believe that you know that is because you have to do it in a book and because a professor said it to you and asked you to regurgitate on a stupid examination. What experiments have you done on the brain to teach you what the reality? What experiments have what experiments have you done on yourself related to the brain to learn what neural networks truly do? What do you know about the brain that you haven't read from a book? Would you would you agree that, what the imaging, what the PET scans show, do they show any part of truth? The trouble isn't with the imaging. The trouble is with the extrapolation. So you may you may you may see an imaging which shows the anatomy of a particular organ. The two hemisphen may show the group glucose uptake in certain so what? Yeah.

Well, the question is not the question is not an intellectual and all that human beings know is intellect because this is what they've been taught in their educations, and this is how they relate to others and what society preaches with all of the books that it publishes and all the media that is out there.

Therefore, asking a question through the vehicle of intellect leads only to concepts, and concepts do not have nothing whatsoever to do with truth. So it isn't about the intellectual question.

      "text": "So from the beginning of existence, like, there has been suffering and some people's finding truth. We're able to find the truth. And it's been going on and on and on, like, for thousand millions of years. It's gonna be that way. Some people seek truth. What is the point of where is this? Or is there a name? Well, I don't think the people who found truth are asking that question. I think only the people who are suffering are in that question. But still, I don't know where I mean, is there an end to all this? Why is I don't I do you didn't answer my question, but you didn't answer my question. What what do you mean by an end to all this? It depends what you mean by this because the person who has found truth is this is truth, and he is not asking what is the end to it. So it's only the sufferer who is asking where is an end to this. So so it sounds like it will be there forever. Well, it doesn't matter. The vast majority the defect is that the vast majority of human bear born will die ignorant, and every human being suffer sooner. But there is a small number of human be who will find truth. The overwhelming majority the overwhelming overwhelming will not. That is that and it will always be that way. But that is not because of some preordainment. That is because human beings believe in socialization. They believe in society. They believe in the world. They believe in unity. They believe in other people. And so long as that is there, maybe you should ask that. When is that going to come? Because if that comes to an end, the thing which you're talking about will automatically come. But you cannot expect that people do things that are all based upon lies and then ask the question, Well, when is this gonna come to an end that people don't mind truth? There has to be some level of personal responsibility, should there not? If a person does not devote themselves to truth, and instead devotes themselves to lies, what right does he have to gain truth? What right does the universe have to give him freedom or freedom from suffering? Why should he? Nothing in this life is free. The people who are in this path have got the opportunity to Who's on this path? I mean, or What what do you mean that people on this path? Seeking truth. Whoever whoever is seeking truth Well, those those who have those right. Well, no. I don't think so. Opportunity is created. Even suffering. Even suffering. You're not listening. You keep talking. You keep you keep talking. You're not listening. If you wanna talk on your own, then I can move you back to the audience, and you can talk on your own. Cool. The people who find truth are not the ones who find truth on any preordained path. And all the paths that are in society, from the spiritual path to the self help path to the self development path to the guru path to the this path to the stoicism path, all those are garbage paths. They just lead to more circles and dead ends. So no one on those paths finds truth. Those rare individuals who find truth are the ones who walk away from all societal. And because there is no individual who is willing to shed society and the world, there's no individual who finds truth. That is perfectly fair. Hi. How am It is a guru is completely irrelevant. A guru will lead you astray. It is not about a guru because a guru will prescribe to you. And since all prescription lead only back to themselves, you will move in circles forever. So you're saying not having no guru? Not saying that at all. And I know what you're going to say because all conditioned peoples because I have said that, now you're saying now you will ask. So you're saying I should not have a guru? Truth lies in thinking for yourself. If you don't see and it appears that you don't, and there's nothing wrong with them, that's perfectly fine. If you do not see how prescriptions destroy human beings and prevent any possibility of arriving to go, the lack of that realization will lead you to questions such as, should I or should I not have a guru? So the serious person will try to realize, not ask which one should I do. And the moment that they're told that the guru is has no meaning, then they ask, well, then should I not have a guru? This is exactly what you'll get. Hi. Thank you for letting me speak today. So, I just I think I remember in one of your clubhouse talks you you mentioned, maybe you don't remember,",

That that's what the, next question was. What belief is? Okay. So if you don't know what belief is, then why would you ask if you should believe it if you don't even know what belief is? Okay. Thanks. Hi there. How are we to know anything? You don't know anything, and that isn't something that anyone really ever comes to realize. So does truth matter? For you, no. Hi.",

I'm not saying it shouldn't I'm not saying it shouldn't be. If if that's what you're looking for, so be it. No. Thing I was trying to understand was a normal human being, which is going from the waves of life, is traveling. Certain ups and downs come in his life. So when he reaches that particular realization at the end of that particular down or that up, is that familiar? Is that does that sense with that particular realization when we are doing the passing or going through a sensation? Well, number one, I will state that these things that you're mentioning that you're doing that give that, you think are going to give you realization, then they won't. Number two, don't even listen to what I just said because you're not ready for it. Number three, don't don't stop doing it. But I have no interest in changing your belief or thinking opinion in any way. But if you're asking me the question of is the realization that you have when you're doing the technique the same realization that you have when you come out of the down or out of the up, I would say that you're not having realized it in either. But I'm not telling you that you should stop. But you ask me the questions, I'm giving you an answer.",

Well, I don't I don't know because different people have different, vocabularies to describe. I mean, one could feel numb to something when they're upset. One could feel because handle it anymore.

No, because you're pursuing it from an intellectual perspective. Understanding is only under it's free of the mind. It is much more about realization.

What does it, mean? I I wanted to ask specifically to you, what does the ego mean to you? Every single thing that you think about yourself is ego. Your entire life revolves every human entire life revolves of ego. Everything. There is nothing in your life that is not not one thing. So, my follow-up question would be somebody who has attained a certain, I would say, let's say, Nirvana or certain, place in their life, do do you or rather, would I ask you, do you think that you you have that ego or are you can somebody able to eradicate that egoness, about yourself at some point? The answer to that is yes. However, it is the same answer as with truth because everyone will come at it from a prescriptive viewpoint. Practically, the answer is no. You find a person who does not come at it from a prescriptive viewpoint, which is essentially nobody, then the answer is no. But but, yes, if there is a person who does not come at it from a prescriptive viewpoint, then absolutely, they can they can live without ego. They can arrive at that. But because the conditioning of humans is so complete and so ubiquitous and so pervasive across all domain, across all culture, the number of human beings in this world who would not come had anything from a nonprescriptive place is you probably could count on one hand. Thank you so much. So it is possible to be evil as Yes. Yes. And if I may ask you, are you in that place today? What does it take? Am I am I on it my honest answer to it is I I have little to no interest answering questions about myself. What does it take? Like everything of any value and which requires a sincere devotion. Thank you. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Hi, Sidha. I have a question.",
