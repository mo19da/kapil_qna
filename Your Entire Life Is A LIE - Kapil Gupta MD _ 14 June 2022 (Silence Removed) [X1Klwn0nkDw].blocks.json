      "text": "Hi, Topple. I just had a question about greatness. I remember you did a podcast on on greatness and how you how Tiger Woods let's use Tiger Woods, for example. Do you think he was is considered great because how he he was born that way, or do you think that he became great because of, just he that's what he really wanted? That was his ultimate desire, or do you think that's something that's innate in the individual? I think I think the things that are I think the thing first of all, I would say that I think anything can be attained. But I think the things that tend to be innate are talent and the DNA, a way of thinking, a certain nature. If one has an intensely social nature, if one has a nature and a DNA to follow others, and to be swayed by the world, and to love socialization, those people don't become great. Because they're, they're followers. So the innateness is more in the direction of sure talent, but also one's nature. There's, there's scores of talented individuals who never become great, who never approach greatness. And that's that can be seen in every discipline, in every environment. Thank you.",

If there is such a thing as happiness, it is found in abandoning the need to have it. I mean, I am trying to understand it, but I'm still figuring it out. If abandoning is the key, then what should I do with my brain? What should I Well, I never told you to abandon it. But the more you the the happiness is happiness is a myth, and I don't think that many people, hardly anyone is ready to hear that because happiness is the center point of everyone's life. And there really isn't anyone who's willing to abandon anything with regard to happiness. It's it's the entire reason they move. Hello. Is it possible to discover your own my own, to discover what I'm truly seeking? If there is even a little amount of fear or, little amounts of need needs are present in my life. The the attempt to get rid of these things never works. So the the question won't really get you anywhere because you're implying that first, you must get rid of these things, the fears and the needs. And once you do, the only then you'll be able to build those things don't work. It doesn't it doesn't work that way. Every everyone is trying to do something, everyone, because that's what everyone has been taught. That's the prescriptions. That's the conditioning. That's the brainwashing. Those are the lies. Do this and do that and get rid of this and become better at that and stop doing this and start doing this. You know, all that crap is just this this destroyed human beings beyond any any hope.",

If if one reaches the end of that path and and understands the truth more fully, does that does that is the effect of that that the fear goes away? I I would imagine that the game is ruined forever, but, does does the fear go away at the end of that? It doesn't matter.

Oh, no. What don't you understand about that? I mean, everybody's gain is not saved. Right? Then if you don't have this, the specific DNA that you're talking about, how will one arrive the truth? That means everybody is, like, out of the rates. Right? Is Is that so? If you don't have the DNA if you don't have the DNA to be a mountain climber, if you don't have the DNA to put up with 80 mile an hour winds on an icy cliff, at harsh cold with low oxygen, if you don't have the DNA to to withstand that and to do what it takes to climb mount the mountain, will you be a mountain climber? No. So does that mean that you won't be anything? No. But it means that not only time is not for you. But there may be other things for which you do have the DNA for. But most human beings don't have the DNA to see truth. That so so that's just true. So you may not likely answer because you're used to books telling you that everything is good and just think positive and think happy thoughts, and one day you'll get there and practice this and that and do all this crap. But the reality is, if you go to the cemetery and five minutes before everyone dies, if you go to the hospital or you go to any place in which people are dying, and five minutes before they die, ask them, have you are you on the verge of truth? Have you ever sought truth? And out of a million people that you interview, find the numbers. So there's your answer. So there's no hope in you, one day all will be fine, and you will get there, and just keep practicing, and keep your chin up, and think of the bright side. All that is complete crap. Those are all lies. That's not true. It's not true. That a vast majority of human beings will live a stupid life, completely ignorant, chasing social ideals, chasing idiotic things, they will completely and utterly waste their life. And I'm not saying that, watch out that you will waste your life unless you do this. There is no unless. You will. Now, am I talking to you specifically? No, because I don't know you. But if you look at the numbers, 99.999%, now you may be the point 000001%. I can never say that you're not. I don't know you. You might be. But the fact remains that this this hope idea that just, you know, put your head in the sand and buy a book called Hope and flip through the pages and one day you'll just get there. Those things just sound nice because human beings don't like to know the truth. They want things that sound nice, that's why bumper stickers sell. So bumper stickers are shiny, they're colorful, they're they're they're they're gold plated. But that's just not true. And it isn't true because I say so, it's because the evidence says so. So there's some mild, almost fear and outrage in your question that if I don't have the DNA for it, then then that means that I'm just not gonna get there. That's just not acceptable. Well, that it may not be acceptable to you, but it's just the fact.",

      "text": "Hi, Kabel. I can't say for everyone, but for me, I completely agree with you that my life is, full of lies. The system, the ideologies, it's complete lie. But can you tell me why did we, after these many generations of, thinking in different cultures, why did we get to a life of lies and not the truth? Thank you. Well, this many generation well, this many generations of lies. Yeah. But, You said this many you said this many generations of thinking. Yes. The thinking was all lies. So all these things are passed on from two generations. But, but if you but it it it can't you're you're too quick to respond. So sorry. I'm I'll erase it. Okay. Okay. So if you if you ask a question and you hear the answer, then I either don't ask the question or don't listen to the answer. If you're gonna keep coming back with a retort, that means you're not listening to the answer. Not that you should, but then why'd you ask the question? Sorry. Please continue. Human beings do not seek truth. So in any given generation, how many are seeking truth? One? Three? Three and a half? 4.375? Okay? So if only 4.375 individuals in every generation are seeking truth and the rest are all lies, then what's going to get passed on? Things don't things don't evolve towards betterment, they devolve towards degradation. If you look at society, society is getting worse with every generation it's not getting better it's getting worse with every generation. If you look at the children of each generation, they're more and more stupid. They're not more and more intelligent. They're more and more intelligent as to how to play video games and figure out computers, but they're more and more dull. And the reason is is because the society in which they're not their fault, the society in which they are born to is more and more dull. Each successive society, each successive generation values the lower and the lower and the lower. That's why all the books that are published are trash. That's why the bestseller lists are full of trash. That's why trash sells. That's why every movie that's put out is all about special effects and curse words. It isn't quality. It isn't art. That's why sports has gone downhill. Everything with every generation goes downhill. So your question was a surprise that, well, with every generation after all this thinking, why would we still be living in lies? And your your implication was that with each successive generation through all that thinking, that there should be a movement towards higher things. There should be a movement towards something that's more evolved, when it's completely the opposite. If you look at society, everyone is more comfortable today than they were a hundred years ago. And yet the comfort increases, but the stupidity also increases. Humans are dull. Humans are beer drinking, bar chasing creatures. They are lower than the low. They have become the lowest in the history of human civilization. And five generations from now, you might have super duper computers, and you might have jets which fly you to the moon, but those who ride those jets will be idiots. They'll be even more idiotic than they are today. And there'll be even more beer drinking going on on those jets than there are today. So with each passing generation, it is lies that are taking taken to an exponential level. There's your answer.",

In regards to what you just mentioned about, comfort being a, a, I guess, a technology that's a technology, a thing with with with time, Will, will there be for the people that, that self discipline themselves and are rigorous self disciplined, or is there any truth to that, or is that just an illusion that they're making up in this world? Self discipline what do what do you mean by self discipline? What does that mean? Like, the fad of new people I guess, like, the new guru who is obsessed with, like, extreme rigid discipline in their life, whether it's, like, physical fitness or, like, sticking to, like, a lot of You don't have to go you don't have to go to even to that detail. Basically, if an individual is interested in society, if he's interested in the culture, if he's interested in in the the the technology, I I don't mean if one has a this tech technology is his craft and he's interested in it from a profession standpoint. I don't mean that. I mean, in terms of believing that technology is gonna make him a better person or make him evolve or have some idiotic app which makes you meditate or thinks that an app can actually make you, think better or be more calm. They they just do stupid ideas that are so insane, laughable. A person who who is amenable to these things, a person a person who who who craves or is moves towards intellectualism and read the latest books about those wearing togas and stoicism to make themselves sound smart, Those who subscribe to society and to the world and to all of the disciplines of the world, you don't have to go to the level of one fitness or this or that. You don't have to go to that detail. I mean, just generally, those who subscribe to the world of people and their beliefs and their systems and politics and the media and just the whole thing as a whole, that individual who was moved and swayed by those things, who lends more than two ears to those things, that that individual, will just devolve along with the rest of everyone. Everyone is basically doomed. And the only way not to live a fiery hell of a life and to die stupid and ignorant, having achieved nothing of any substantive value, is if you're complete contrarian. Not not for contrarian sake, but because one recognizes the the superfluousness and the superficiality and the cosmesis of society in his heart. If that and and that got the DNA, that sort of thing is a DNA. Usually, it's an individual who moves against everything. He's just against everything, and he can never pinpoint where that came from. It's just a DNA. So it isn't even self discipline. That's a societal idea. It's an intellectualism. That's a it's a that's a how to discipline yourself. Make sure you have a routine and and morning routines and make sure you eat avocado toast and make sure that you breathe properly in the morning, and make sure that you have an ice bath, and all these idiotic things. Little discipline because those are also societal movements. It is it is a natural inclination without choice of turning one's back on the idiocy of society by recognizing that all of life in the world, all of the world is a circus. And anything short of that, using fancy words like self discipline, is not a movement away from that. It's a movement directly into it.",

I just wanna thank you, for putting me on the path to see that my entire life was a lie over, what, ten years ago. And it it took, a lot of time for me to truly understand your writing and your, your point. I'm still understanding, tell you the truth. The sincerity is always there. I just wanna let you know that, I'd be forever grateful. What I have learned, these past six months has been life changing, and I think that it helped me, understand how my life as a doctor before was totally a lie because I was chasing I've chase after chase. Like, I was like a machine doing things automatically, competing, trying to better others. But now for the last six months, I am so grateful to you because I have found, that when my life slowed down, tremendously is slowing down every day, and sometimes I just I just go find a place, alone, a meditative spot around a lake or something and slow everything down with long, long observation time, before doing anything. I have my sketchbook, my planner, you know, painting material. I just give it the process infinite time, and I am not in a rush. I am whatever. I can make a painting out of a day, or I may not, but it's not doesn't even matter anymore. So I don't know how to thank you. I'd be forever grateful. I am so happy that our path crossed. I wish nothing but the best for you and your family, and I am aware of the good things about that, Aman, and everything. Man, I am thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. My life is, like, very slowed down, and it was a lie before. You were totally right. It was a total lie because I I wasn't living. Really, it wasn't a life. It wasn't a life. It was I was in a prison made by my mind, I guess. But now it's Thank you. Thank you, Capio. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Life is painful, and it it deserves seriousness because the one life that a human being has is the only life. It is the only thing he has in this world. It's just his life or her life. It is serious business to insult one's life by chasing how to's. To insult one's life by trying to read a book or listen to someone to give them a five step plan or a method or a hack. It is so demeaning to one's own self. It is so diminishing of the value of one's life. It is like attempting to build a crib for one's child and trying to read a how to book and put all of one's faith in the how to book in making a safe crib for the infant. Nobody would do that because the infant is important to the individual, and one could not risk that. Yet one would yet one human beings risk their lives every day. They insult their lives every day. By relegating them to reading magazine articles and 400 page books about self help. That's how little human beings think of their lives. There is no seriousness in this world. There is no sincerity in this world. And this is why humans live lives that have no value whatsoever the way they are living them. That is why anxiety and pain and disappointment and fear and misery and suffering are the order of the day. And the world and its minions, and their spiritual gurus with their meditation and their incense, and the whole gang comes to sprinkle all their nonsense upon things that are serious problems, deep and serious pains that humans have. And to come and diminish them by telling them to go meditate, by putting them into exile, into a corner, and saying, go practice mindfulness, you'll be fine. It is the height of hypocrisy. It is an insult to the value that is a human life.",

I mean, it all depends upon the person, but understanding you know, these are just words. Right? But it generally, if if one really understands something, then they understand. I mean, if one calls it understanding what they actually memorized or they actually believed or opined or they took someone's award for it, then they could use then they could cover that up and call it understanding.

What I'm curious about is starting from there, how do you get to the importance of taking life so seriously as you were mentioning before? And Well, I I everything is about context. And so you have to understand what I'm saying. And it's very difficult for someone to understand if they're new here, which I imagine that you are, because I never said anything about taking life serious. Every the the the English language the English language has context. And the words, when you put them together in a certain way, they mean something other than simply the sum of the words. So for instance, if I say to you, who do you think you are? That will sound derogatory. That will sound like an attack. Because in the English language, when you put that phrase together, that's in the vernacular. That's what it usually means. But if I ask it innocently, which no one ever does, it will never come across that way. It'll come across an attack. Like, why are you asking me that? In the same way So that makes sense. You assume you k. So you assumed that what I said was that you must take life seriously. And that that is a phrase. Each of those words have their own meaning, but when you put them in that context, it's the same as asking who do you think you are. I never said anything about taking life seriously or not seriously. I said that life, because it is filled with suffering and misery and anxiety, human beings have real problems. And, therefore, in order to in order to get to the bottom of things, one must be serious. One must can't one can't take a fleeting, approach at them. One cannot just swipe them away using nonsensical things. That is very different than saying, be take life seriously or not seriously. That's a whole other context.",

And although it gave me a sense of accomplishment upon achieving it, it also I also realized my life was a lie because the accomplishment didn't do for me what I thought it would and didn't live up to the expectations of, you know, solving my life's problems. After doing so, it's led me to a place where I simultaneously have a longing to do more. But there's this almost nihilistic understanding that it won't do anything for me. And it's truthfully left me stuck in a place where, like I said, I'm longing to do more, but I have the nihilistic almost nihilistic, like, understanding that it won't do anything for me. So I feel like I'm stuck in this position with this conflict between these two ideas and have any insight. I can't help you how to get how to get unstuck. Is there a measurable goal in your life that you'd like to accomplish before you die? What do you care? All that matters is you, not me. Hello.",

It really really is it really must be of resonance to you, not me prescribing to you in any way. Gupta, thank you so much for all the work that you do. My question is, basically, I've been, I've been exposed to your work for about a year now. And I feel like at times I've understood that the illusion of the self, but I feel like I'm not I haven't fully understood it viscerally. Is there or what is the is there a desire that's keeping me from seeing the illusion? Yeah. The higher the the more deeply developed or the more naturally deep one desire is for something, and they will keep moving towards that past all the misunderstandings, towards the end until they do understand. So the answer to your question is is yes, but it it doesn't mean that you go and try to find that desire. What's self realization? If they have any role in the in truth or because one feels guilty. I feel guilty whenever I feel comfortable or No. Even even even growth has no role in anything.",

My wife suffered a stroke about six years ago, and everything I do is devoted to recovery, to help, not expecting anything in return. I'm just devoted to doing that. The second thing is that I'm also devoted to understanding what's going on with our economy, crypto, all other stuff. I just spend all those times, and it's like even three hours listening to podcast seems like time that did fly. And then I'm I'm relatively free. I'm retired, financially free, even the beach. Good morning walks. I enjoy the waves, looking at waves, listening to birds chirping, etcetera. But the one thing that always comes up is when I think about when you die, what happens? I really don't know. Where am I? Well, I what happens when you die is an irrelevant question because the problems of life are more immediate and practical. As for your wife, I'm sorry to hear that she suffered a stroke. And but as for what happens after you die is irrelevant. The immediacy of life is what begs your attention. Okay.",

And, like, my parents or I've also seen this with other kids. Like, they would say that an ideal mind is a devil's workshop. Sorry. An ideal mind. But at some point and so, like, we are always then, asked to go after things and, like so that we are we are on a treadmill and then so that we can go get to the next step and so on. I suppose my question is, like, I see that this is, like, a necessary skill that parents have to teach their children, like, to just get punctured with things and, like, get on with life and so on. But, is there a way for parents to sense that they're doing something that is somehow injecting that poison that you talk about and, like, the conditioning? Yeah. Like Well, the only or the only way is if a parent if if it's not about him as or her role as a parent because there's no such thing. It's a human being. And it's a human being can only recognize the the real depths of the mistakes they make. I'm not talking about spilt milk. I'm talking about one's ways, one's philosophies, the things that one believes in, the things that one subscribes to on a deep level.

And, I guess these days, I'm faced with a sort of a tough decision where, to get to where I am today. My my cofounder had to do an immense amount of work over many, many years inventing and, doing all sorts of research that I guess nobody else in the world is doing. That's why we have what we have today and but where we wanna go, of course, is much harder, to be more specific. We have a a durable, dexterous hand, robotic hand today, and it's powered by entirely new technology than what the traditional conventions use. Servo motors, today we use, my cofounder's proprietary artificial muscles. And, the question is that, these days, I'm based on the decision about kind of maybe reverting to the traditional way of doing things for part of getting to where we need to go and, titrating out potentially, somebody who's, seemingly was essential to get to where we are, but not necessarily essential to where we need to go. And I'd I I I'm I'm sure, I should be more dog dogmatic about doing things, our own way with only inventors trying to kind of take things to next level and not sort of revert back to No. Because you're you're looking at things from a prescriptive way, what you should do, what you should not do.

She's expecting some words from me, but I don't feel like giving this warmth. And I I I I understand that I don't I can't make her change, and it is what it is. But there is something about me that bothers inside me about myself that I cannot, show her kindness. So when when there's something within you that bothers you Yeah. Reaches a fever pitch, reaches a particular level Yeah. Then then whatever needs whatever you feel will need to be done, you will do. And until that time, you will allow beliefs and opinions to override communication and expressing or getting along or whatever it may be. And nothing about it is good or bad or wrong or right.",

One of your one thing that you said last time that really hit home was examine what your heart genuinely seeks aside from conditioning. And I've been doing that, but I haven't found conviction. And, in trying to understand and transcend my mind or, like, the illusion of self, I find myself in, like, a loop between multiple self that often contradict each other. And I'm trying to understand and accept each of these, and hope that that will resolve them and get closer to the truth. But I guess my question is, is this Are you an intel are you an intellectual? I don't know how to answer that, but I as in do you think, do you mean that I have a tendency to intellectualize things? No. Are you an academic? I'm not. Are you a book reader? I I do read books, sir. So you you're that's the trouble that you're in is you're doing all these things and all intellectual things. Mhmm. There's nothing there's nothing really heartfelt or sincere about anything that you said, that you didn't say anything bad or wrong. Mhmm. It's just it's all just intellectualizing. Mhmm. And that usually happens to intellectuals. And everyone intellectualizes, but the intellectual, he there's no way he'll get out of it because he's actually proud of his intellectualizing. That's what gives him his his, meaning for life.",

And so I did the usual circuits, philosophy, western, eastern science, including a lot of field books. And, I've taken joy in reading them and sometimes tried also that I understand this concept, and I am explaining it to someone. But then someone comes and asks me, have you what have you attained? And I realized all I have is words and theories. And even you mentioned sometimes, like, are you a Buddha yet? Or why are you not? And I don't even know what it means to be a Buddha. So my question basically is after reading all of this and realizing it's just theories and some of it is all non falsifiable in nature, What is it that one gets at the end of all of this? What is it that the great people throughout history, if it is all true, the stories? What did the Buddha or the Buddha, the Manama Harishi, etcetera, what did they chance upon him? Sincerity. Sincerity. Devotion. They weren't chasing intellectualisms. When Buddha first went into the jungle, what happened? He was given prescriptions by the ascetics. And for years, he sat and ate drank his own urine and, became emaciated and ate one grain of rice, and he did all the nonsense that they told him to do. And what happened? Nothing. Therefore, he left, because he was all crap. And the greater the the the lesson there, as is the same with anybody who truly achieves anything that is of any extraordinary level in life. It's all about sincerity. It's seriousness. It is doing what needs to be done to get to where one wishes to go. No backup plans. No nonsense. No follow this, follow that. All those people who have followed this and followed that have gotten nowhere. So sincerity. Bottom line, there's no getting around it.",

There is constant chaos that goes in our mind, you know, and it's just very difficult to control sometimes, what a normal person should do and how one should live life with this chaos or, even if the meditation or anything is not working out. Well, there's no even if. The meditation will not work. But don't take my word for it. You'll find out for yourself soon enough. So no one the Buddhism and all isms and this ism and that ism, It's it's it's it's for the common and the mediocre and the masses. It's those are things just to keep people busy, to keep them occupied. It's like people who they keep the prisoners busy by making them break rocks or do the laundry. It isn't real. It's nonsense. So you can meditate for the next five thousand years. You won't get anywhere. You shouldn't listen to me. Does that mean that you should stop meditating? No. Because if it's in your heart and you are moved to do it, then there's no reason not to. But you can follow every ism by the book, and the Gita's on every single shelf, and so is the four noble truths and the eightfold path. And how many Buddhas do you see walking around? So compare the number of Buddhas you see to the number of those books that are sitting on the shelves. Compare the number of Gita's that you see compared to the number of Krishna's walking around. It's all nonsense. Nothing happens that way. Buddha would never have become Buddha by reading a Buddhism book about the eight four path and the four noble truth. It's crap. It's not real. It's just to keep you busy. And Krishna did not become Krishna by reading the Gita. Does that mean that the things that are written in the Gita are wrong? No. It doesn't mean that. Does that mean it doesn't it doesn't contain truths? No. It contains some truth, but but the individuals who read those books are doing so in order to find prescriptions and how tos and methods. And in all the reality of the situation, as ironic as it may be, is that the spiritual books that reveal any truth at all can only be imbibed by one who has already reached a certain level of enlightenment or realization. That's the irony. Because if one has not, those books will do nothing for them. They might as well read comic books.",

My question to you is that, I read Baba Gita, and it says that there's answers for every, question of the lives in it. So, but by implementing it or by just reading about it, I will I implemented my life, basically, so that I get all the questions which are there in the book. Is there a question there? How do I solve my problem there, Avi? One question, like, one basic question incident that happened The the connection the connection is very bad. I I heard you say that you are implementing it. I don't I don't understand the question. Yes. I'm implementing it, but it is still not working. That is my question. Well, isn't that is isn't isn't that what I just said? The the last the last questioner? Yeah. But I need a pro I mean, there are a level, like, this is the first time I'm listening to this this kind of So how to's, prescriptions, methods, techniques, hacks, poojas, this, that, prayers. It's all crap. It's all lies. It's all nonsense. You can invite every guru to your house. You can have satsang and puja for twenty four hours a day for the next five hundred and seventy two years. You can fill your house with incense until your house burns down. You can read every letter of the Gita, and you can you can have implementation sessions, and you can follow every single word, and nothing will happen. And the reason is because prescriptions don't work. You can't make a thing work if it doesn't work. How tos and methods don't work, and there are no books that are written except for mine. I don't recommend that you read them. There are no books that are written that don't prescribe. They all prescribe. Practice this. Do this. Sit and do this. Twenty minutes of meditation. Close your eyes, watch your thoughts. Do this. Blah blah blah blah blah blah. Okay. Everyone's doing it. They're all blah blah ing. Are they getting anywhere? As you yourself have found in your own direct experience, no. So the answer to your question is, it isn't that you've implemented the wrong thing, It's that you've implemented at all. Those things are not where the truth lies. Truth lies in the sincerity to look for the truth and what actually does work. And the only thing that works is the truth. How to's are not the truth. If they were, then when Buddha first went into the jungle and he ate the one grain of rice and drank his own urine, then he would have become enlightened. And the ascetics who told him to do so, who had been practicing, the lovely word that all religions love is practice. Spirituality dies for practice, because they want you to practice forever. So they were all practicing before Buddha got there. Did they get anywhere? What's the first thing he should have asked? He shouldn't have sat there and dry and drank his own urine and ate the one grain of rice. He should have said, I will do whatever you want. I only have one question. How long have you been doing this nonsense? And they might say, well, I've been doing it for fifteen years. Okay. Well, have you got anywhere doing it? Obviously, they hadn't. Well, why would he waste his time then? So that's That's what to that's what's to learn. But even then, you shouldn't imbibe it. The only reason it may resonate with you is because you have found this in your own experience. You aren't taking my word for it. Truth is the only thing. Not books, not not ceremonies, not statues, not religion, not spirituality, not self help. Those are all billion dollar lies. Thank you for that, Thomas. Thank you for your answers, sir. I'm truly enlightened. And, honestly, I'm gonna read your books. Thank you so much. Sure.",

So I just wanted to get a clarification on it. So if if what you're saying is, how do I say this? If someone is drawn to things like meditation or Kirtan, for example, and they find truth with but it's natural and organic, and they find truth within that versus someone telling them to go practice meditation, to go practice kirtan. Is that what you're saying is the difference that you can find truth if one is following their own or that you will not find it within meditation at all or you won't find it within Well, any well, anything that one does in order as a practice or a how to or a method in order to get something else is fine. Whether they're whether they I mean, if they do it because they're moved to do it and they just happen to enjoy it, the same way that they happen to enjoy, a walk in the park or they happen to enjoy eating ice cream or they happen to enjoy flying the kite.

And for me, that state of being is a state of acceptance as opposed for, say, forceful intent or using my intellect. It's more intuition in that sense that of being in a state of being in which those truths arise. My question is, earlier on, a person asked about a question regarding society, and you answered that, you know, when you are within society, society then tends to corrupt you with the with its lies. And, by being in its environment, I can understand from experience how that how that, comes to be. My question is when you discover or when you're in those state when you're in that state of being of acceptance in which you're able to intuitively grasp those truths, how is it that you can prevent yourself from being corrupted by those lies while living in society? Because I only question that from your own experiences in the sense that you have learned certain things from experience, which has come to pass as wisdom. You are now in society, and you choose to be like that. But at the same time, I sense that you haven't changed that sense of intuition in in your state of being. How do you prevent yourself from being corrupted with society? Well, I don't look for states. As long as you have to look for states, those things will come along once every blue moon. And, I cannot rely on such ephemeral, and and and temporary things such as a state.",
