In one of your talks, you said that someone who's busy feeding his stomach might not be you know, have such a strong seek for truth. But in my case, though I'm not financially free, I have a very, like I don't know why I'm just attracted to your work and these things. So what is the role of truth for someone who's trying to be financially free? Well, if someone is seeking truth, then they everything has truth. So there is no reason to go live in a cave. In whatever one's work is, there is truth. Unless one does it in a cosmetic fashion or unless one does something that one has no limited talent or limited interest for, then there is absolute truth in in everything. So truth is not distinct from life. In fact, it is the only relevant portions of life. Everything else is insignificant. Oh, I'm sorry. I pressed the raise hand button. Ballistic.",

And I'm just trying to understand is truth seeking in your experience something that is gradual and almost a valuable process? Sorry? Why do you think that you live a valuable life? I feel like when, like, kind of by default, like, beef before I was really, is it alright if I think about it? You can come back when you're ready when you're ready. Okay. Thank you.",

I just wanna understand why it occurs, what why why we humans, feel inertia and don't don't is that a is that a is that question kind of clear? No. It's a little messy. Yeah. I'm not sure what context you're using inertia in. The context I'm using it in is in the sense that I remember you put a tweet once. Men coast, but even when they realize progress isn't actually getting to where you wanna get, it progress suits itself. It it's a chase for itself. You realize that people don't really do anything. It's almost as if we run-in place instead of having a desire to take us from one place to another. Well, no. That's absolutely true. The human being does run-in place, but that shouldn't be that you take my word for it. That should be fairly obvious. And if it's not, it's okay. It just means that one has to examine to see how he is running in place. I guess, that that makes sense. I just wanted to understand. I guess it's self image. I don't wanna just thought, like, oh, it's just the mind. I was just I don't wanna thought a cliche answer. But It's just it's an it's important to remember one thing.

      "text": "Again, so I I there's few reasons I I think are the way I look at, what a valuable life is in the way I live. For example, kind of having a state of flow, being very immersed in what I'm doing, at the same time kind of feeling like I'm very aware in that meditative state, and then also kind of the feedback I get from other people saying that, that my voice kind of cuts through the noise or I look at things very clearly. I know it's kind of cliche, but a few things like that, I think, is my default state of living, but not necessarily where I spend the majority of my time. Okay. Okay. And so my question is, you talk a lot about arrival. And in my experience, I'm spending more time as I become more experienced in the pitfalls and and and understanding how I can avoid them. And is is it in your experience, is it kind of a gradual process that you continuously improve at, or it might be more effective to look at something that's more of a sudden arrival? Well, transformation does happen in an instant. There is no such thing as building towards progress as a myth, particularly in things. The things that I discussed are not mechanical, And so it's gonna be the opposite of mechanical. In the world of mechanics, you can get a prescription. In the world of mechanics, there is progress. If you're building a house, there are your progress that, you know, the foundation is done or the 1st Floor is done. But in this, in the realm of the mind, in the realm of, human transformation, there is no such thing as, collecting enough points, gaining enough rewards, putting in enough time, doing enough good deeds, practicing enough austerities, meditation hours. All of those things are calendar to truth. They don't go anywhere. So if there is something that allows someone to get somewhere, it truly is seriousness and maturity. And if something takes time, it is probably that. It isn't the arrival is not being prevented, by not doing the right thing or not practicing enough austerities. The arrival is being prevented by the fact that you don't really want it enough yet. And the moment that someone wants it, then they're all in, and they expose themselves to truth, twenty four seven. And that's a person who demonstrates that to himself that that's what they truly want.",

Well, because you understand it only intellectually, And the feelings arise from the fact that if it's really true, then it stands starkly in the background of the falsehoods that you're used to, and therefore it provides a feeling. But it doesn't last because it isn't truly understood. It isn't truly imbibed.",

      "text": "Good evening, Kapil. There are two things that I feel have been preventing me from living a valuable life. One, I've been plagued by, a sense of loneliness, for many years from relationships with other people just dying or fizzling out. The second thing is been plagued by self doubt with, achieving my career aspirations. I've explored these things for a long time, and I feel I'm gotten nowhere and I'm still stuck. And I suppose my question is, what am I missing? What have I not seen? Thank you. Be examined. I mean, you haven't really explored because the only tools up until this point that you ever had are prescriptions. And, therefore, you've always looked at things from the standpoint of what did I do wrong, who's to blame, how could I have been better, and all of these things. And so the only tools that you had at your disposal were the ones that society gave to you. And, therefore, until you find that until you find discover the realization in yourself, not because I say, but on your own, that those tools are not effective for you or for anyone, and you cannot say that you've already found them because you haven't. You haven't been following my work long enough to know that yet. So, until that that realization dawns that those tools, of prescription and rightness and wrongness and betterment and improvement and modification and strategy and routine and hacks and all of these things and methods, until those are seen to be ineffective and utterly wasteful, that's what you have not seen. Thank you.",

My question is, during these, pandemic times, what are some, I guess, advice that you can bring to people who wish to continue to perform at, the highest of their ability? When has it when has it not been pandemic times? Oh, I love that. Good question. I think that I did a discourse about this. It's always been a pandemic time. If it isn't coronavirus, it's your own anxiety. Yes. If it is corona if it is coronavirus, it's your anxiety about coronavirus. And it's your anxiety about it is were you a living Buddha before coronavirus came? So these things these things are all details. They have no meaning. Everyone is just a cosmetic chaser. This is such a this is a very societal question because everyone in society just looks at the current events and then organizes their fears and their and their anxieties around the current events like a swarm of bees. A human being had lived in a pandemic since the day he was born. He has lived in a holocaust since the day he was born. He has never known a life free of fear, free of anxiety, free of sorrow, free of pain, free of tragedy, free of confusion. Therefore, it has always been pandemic times. And as for something to say, there is no balm. There's no good feeling. You're better off chasing the self help experts. If you want a dose of a good feeling and put some ointment on your wounds, this is for serious people who truly wanna get somewhere in the life that they have remaining, in the years that they have left, to truly arrive at somewhere transformational and permanent. That by the time they die, they have at least they can say that they arrived somewhere. At least they have tasted a fraction of what nature intended for them instead of chasing nonsensical prescriptive routines and austerities and self helps and feel goods and bumper sticker and Yahoo and Laugh It Up. It's all it it's it's all so shameful.",

So I guess my question, I guess I should start by saying that I do believe that everybody is living a valuable life just predestined, but that that value gets lost in chasing what society has defined to be the value of human life. And, obviously, it comes to that realization. There's a lot of unlearning and relearning that needs to be done. But I feel like taking that path also involves a lot of intellectualism. And you say that intellectualism is the enemy of truth. So do you think that intellectualism is part of the process in getting to the truth? Not for the intellectual. There's a lot in your question which relates to I said this and I said that. What I say doesn't matter. It isn't about believing me. It is about what you see for yourself. So it doesn't matter that I say that intellectualism will lead nowhere.",

If we choose to do good to someone, adding value and trying to make a positive difference, but if that person do something bad to others, what will happen? Well, you seem to be speaking from experience. What did happen? I'm a fubit. Okay. So you have just provided a prime example of why it's no point doing good for others. These are just falsehoods. It doesn't mean that everyone who does for others is being false. That does not mean that. There are there are some very truly sincere and giving human beings in this world. There genuinely are. But the real reward for a human being, not that he's chasing a reward, but just as a natural byproduct, the real benefit of a human being, the real value to a human being comes when he puts all of his attention on discovering truth in his own life and through discovering purity in his own life as opposed to trying to do good things. There isn't a human being on earth who does a good thing without in some way feeling pleasure for it and feeling that he's getting gonna get points for that. And it doesn't it doesn't diminish what they did because they likely had a very positive impact on another human being's life, and so it doesn't diminish that. But the ultimate is all that matters. The height of heights. And that comes from the examination and the exploration of the value in one's own life. Thank you.",
