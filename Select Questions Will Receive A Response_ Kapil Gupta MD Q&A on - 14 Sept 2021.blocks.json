And as you said that I've already worked at lengths to see the word in a different way. But lot of barriers are coming, and it sometimes breaks me in between, then I have to get up again. Why am I getting so many challenges over and over again even after coming to this best path of life? What is the best path of life that you've come upon? What do you call the best path? What do you mean by new lens? What new lens are you talking about? The new lens to look, at the best in every situation in all the sufferings. Why do you look at the best in every situation? Even when somebody is behaving odd with me and I find it not justified, I try to keep myself calm as a still water. And Okay. And so has and so and and and so so yet despite that, you find that there are you were still bombarded by problems. Right? Yes. I'm still bombarded by problems. Okay. And so that means that means that the end of those problems do not come through the things that you're doing. Is that correct? No. I I do get my solace even after getting the problems. But It doesn't matter it it doesn't matter if you get your solace, the problems come back. Right? They they do. Okay. So so your change of so your change of behavior, and you're looking at the bright side, and you're trying to stay calm like still water Yes. Has that ended your problems? A lot, I would say. I Okay. Then then then then then then continue to do so. Then continue to do it then. Why would you stop continuing to do that? It stops me. It stops me from following it. It breaks me down sometimes, especially when it's a close one who is coming with a stick to justify or to judge me all the time. And I mean, I I I understand your efforts, but they will not get you to where you and and you should not listen to what I just said. It's a realization that you'll have to have for yourself.",

I I just wanted to ask, are our efforts to change, or our situations self deception? Can you help me see that? I mean, self deception is the is lies in self improvement. The, you know, the the attempt to improve oneself and, better oneself while it may be viewed as noble effort, the reality is that it doesn't take anyone anywhere. So the the deception lies in self improvement, self development, behavior change, all of these things. One cannot behavior change their way to realization.",

I'm gonna put you back to the audience, and then I'm gonna, I'm gonna speak on this type of category of question. Those who have come to this room, you're you're welcome here. But if you've come to this room and you have not read any of my materials, you have not understood, where I come from in terms of, no prescriptions and no methodologies and no techniques and and sort of the the lens, of my work. There never feel any compulsion to look at my work. I don't recommend it to anyone. I genuinely mean that. But nothing that I say really will make any sense to you. The people who belong in this room are the ones who either wish to learn something and feel truth for themselves, or they have already been through my work, and therefore, they are seeking truth. These the questions that I get from from the people who have not read my work, are very superficial, cosmetic. And, there's nothing against the people who ask those questions, but this is not the place for them. They're better off asking these questions in in spiritual forums and in self help areas, and maybe asking therapists or whomever they are moved to ask. This is not for you. So if if you have come here unvetted, unself vetted, you're welcome to listen if you wish. I'm not sure what you will get out of it. And if you do, only you could answer that. And if you do, that's that's great for you. But if you have not read my work, don't raise your hand.",

I have been wondering, among philosophy to try to find the truth, but I, figured out it's full of concepts and empty concepts. I'm just wondering, is the truth hidden between these concepts? Or No. Truth is beyond all concepts. All you will find in spirituality, and all you will find in self help, and all you will find in the world, and all the experts, is concepts. That's all that exists are concepts. And the truth is not conceptual. It is for that very reason that the intellectual can never know truth, because truth is beyond the mind, and the intellect and for the intellectual God, for the intellectual, the mind is as God.",

If you are looking for a ball, and the ball is behind you, but you're looking the other way, Will you ever find the ball? Will the ball ever be obvious to you? No. Never. Right. Therefore, every human being is filled with conceptual thoughts. Every human being is awash. Every human being is busy. Everything in a human being is filled up. All of the empty spaces, so to speak, are occupied. The human being lives his life awash in concepts and ideas and beliefs and opinions and techniques and methods. And he is there is never a time when he isn't doing something, trying something, chasing something, hoping for something, something, reading something. Because of that, truth can never get in. If a glass is full of water, then no more water could enter. Therefore, the human being and and even for if for a minute the spaces in the human being's mind became empty and available, He would occupy them immediately with new methods and new techniques. He is so completely smitten and conditioned and brainwashed by society to look for the how tos and the methods and the techniques and chase this and chase that, that the truth can never possibly be obvious to him. Number one. Number two, the truth tends to be hidden practically strategically in places where no sane human being would ever seek to look, would ever think to look. And the only person who would is the person who was recognized that it cannot be found anywhere in society.",

However, I always come to this room whenever I see that you you're hosting one, because certain things that you do say, do resonate with me. My curiosity today was, is there a connection between, once you do find the truth, of attaining inner peace, is there a connection between the two? Or Well, why is it that why is it that a person does not have peace? Who whomever it may be, why is it that why is it that any human being does not have peace? Mhmm. Reliance on society? Society pressures and whatnot? The reason that no one has peace Yeah. Is because what they believe to be true is not true. Okay. So if you if you have a swimming pool, and you should be putting chlorine in that swimming pool, and you're a swimming pool expert, therefore, you know that you should put chlorine in there, but instead you put acid in there, And you jump in the pool. You will suffer. Right. And it has it has nothing to do with jumping in. And what everyone does is, they jump, they pour the acid, they jump in, and then they try to find ways to, to ease the the pain and the burning of the asset. And they spend their entire and that's where all the community of experts come in, and the gurus, and the books, and the speakers, and the priests, and everything. They're all there to put balm and ointment on the acid. And therefore, your entire life, you end up seeking different treatments for the acid. That's your whole life. But the only reason that you suffered in the first place was not because you didn't find the right treatment. It was because you did not realize that the pool required chlorine and non acid. Therefore, the cause of suffering, the cause of not having peace The root is incorrect, basically. That it is not knowing the truth. Got it. Thank you.",

Why is it that, human being is inevitably born into illusion, in ways where, you know, their parents put on their beliefs or whatever they have, whatever they want the child to be like. Because they're not born to a Buddha or a Jesus. But if a if they were born to a Buddha or Jesus, wouldn't they just be putting their conditioning onto the child, even though, for example, they actually No, a Buddha or a Jesus would not be putting their conditioning, because those were masters who had who had discovered the truth, and the person who discovers the truth has no need to condition anybody else.",

If someone brings up a question which begins with, if there is no methodology, what they're saying is that they are that that I have posed something which they have not themselves realized, and they are waiting for me to provide an explanation against their belief with for which there is a methodology. I have no interest in doing that. I'm not I'm not interested in here having a discussion. One must filter everything that I say through themselves, through their own experiences.

I cannot tell you how to move on. There's no lessening of sorrow. There there really is, any attempt to make yourself feel better about it, will only exacerbate your pain.",

Pursuing methods and techniques will lead someone nowhere, but no human being should listen to that either. It must coincide with their own experiences. All things must be filtered through one's own self. To listen to someone else in order to find the answer is to invite illusion. Human beings are fundamentally unhelpable. They will do what they will do. When someone is ready, they are ready. And when they are not, they are not. When a human being is ready for the truth, they will open themselves up to it. When they are not ready for the truth, they will seek prescription. This human life is an opportunity to discover truth. It's not a good thing. It is not a proper thing. No one should do it because there is no should. But in the end, the truth is the only thing there is. Good night.",
