      "text": "Good evening, Kapil. I think I heard about you in 2018. I started reading your books, listening to your podcast, watching your stuff on YouTube, and for years, nothing changed. And over the last few weeks, something inside of me changed, and I don't know how it happened. I mean, I do know how it happened. I kept listening to your stuff, and I would literally listen to you for five hours a day, read your book. I'm not saying this to show off, but I would probably read your books twenty, thirty times. I don't understand it. I don't know why nothing is changing. And then until recently, I just it's like I felt it in my body. Everything changed. It's like everything all of a sudden just hit me, and everything made sense. So I just wanna say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I honestly don't know where I would be without you, and I genuinely, genuinely mean this because things were not going good. I was filled with anxiety, filled with turmoil, filled with pain in my mind. My mind was taken over my whole life. And then over the last four years as I've been on this journey, I can finally say even though I don't wanna say it, I kinda hesitate saying it, but I can finally say that I understand the truth and everything that you've been saying. And I know you'll probably say it wasn't you. It was the words coming through you, but it definitely was you. I just wanna say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I don't really have a question, but I just wanted to let you know thank you so much for everything you do. Genuinely mean it. Thank you. Thank you. I struggle",

So, then it's like a mental torture that are we doing right? Are we doing wrong? Like, something inside us tells to do this way in this particular thing, and other people face to go So so do you do you do you believe the way of society is correct? So what has been told till now, I don't find anything correct till now, but they say that if you will keep doing this, you will come in trouble in future. You will keep coming in trouble. And what That's that makes little And and how how old are you? So I'm 20, I'll I'll be turning 28. So in in twenty eight years, you have received that advice many times. Yeah. K. And so the the if you keep doing this, you will get that. Has that in twenty eight years, has that been true in your experience? Not based upon what people said, but if you examine what actually happened, which nobody can argue with everybody can argue with so and so believes this, and so and so says this, and so and so believes this, and some guru says this, and some friend says this, and some expert says that. But no one can argue with your experience. So in your experience, has that keep doing it and one day it will come? Has that worked? So it has never worked because I have been always a rebellious child, like, not, like, really going against everything and doing the things in my own way. And, so that so that is something must sometimes I feel confident, but sometimes it shakes me in fear that what if this happens with me. So, this is the So I so you have done things your own way. And do you believe that you will stop doing your own way and begin doing things that society tells you to do? Sir, it is very difficult for a person like me to really do that. I don't know why, but it has been decided to Okay. It doesn't require a long an do you believe that you will stop doing what you have always done, which is to do it your own, and you will make a one eighty degree turn and begin doing what society tells you to do? No, sir. No. Okay. So if the answer to that question is no, then what is the use of asking your original question, which is, should I do what society says? Because sometimes, even though I do it my way, I feel like I may be wrong. It doesn't matter because as you have just stated, you're not gonna do that anyway. So there's no question to me. You're just looking to feel good. You're just looking to feel good about, not either doing it your own way or looking to feel good for not having done it society's way. But as you have established, it doesn't matter what the answer to your so called question is. The question isn't really a question because you already know that regardless of what the answer is, you're still going to do it your own way. Therefore, the question has",

      "text": "no meaning. Namaste, Kapil. Like the first speaker said, I am deeply grateful for your work as well. I haven't been exposed to your work, for as long, but, it's been, like, four months. And, I resonate with every single word of yours, and I can't thank you enough. I have this burning question that's been haunting me, and, I I really hope I'm able to articulate it. And please bear with me as I frame it. So this question is, pertains to my daily practice and as it as it relates to prescription. And, over over the I have tried so many meditation practices and, mindfulness and whatnot. But in the past two years, I was, seriously pursuing a yoga technique or a yoga practice as as the guru of this practice puts it. I don't know if you consider the ancient scriptures of, yoga and, you know, Patanjali's yoga, Sutras, for example, ask prescriptions. But, I of late, I I ask question of, if this is this practice really taking people to enlightenment? And some of the arguments that are posed by the teachers and also the guru is, you know, the first quality of a seeker is to understand that you don't know what you don't know. And then when a guru, who is someone who sheds light on the darkness, is showing you the way, that that is a wise thing to follow. But then I go back and say, you know, in my logical mind, I don't know if, I'm progressing or not. But then the argument again from them is, you know, these these are all, like, lifetime's worth of karma that has built up, and these practices are basically burning it. So if you ask, you know, why hasn't these thousands of people haven't achieved enlightenment? Every one of them is working through their own karma of this lifetime and also the past lifetimes. So I am stuck. It could be a sunk cost fallacy, and I have put in so much work. I do see a lot of changes in me. I cannot put whether it is a good change or a bad change, but I I am. So, how do you see this? Is this is this still am I asking the right questions? Is is this following prescriptions that, you know, I am ready to abandon everything and just seriously examine myself? What what is the path that my inner voice would pass on? I think it's it's about examining your experiences and examining your so a lot of people I mean, these things that you're saying have been around for a cent. Now are they true? They might be. They might be. Maybe there's there's karmic debt that has to be paid. You know? Like, there's so many things that a human being simply does not know. And, therefore, it it it is sincerity to recognize the fact that, you know, there may be relevance to what that individual is saying or there may not be. Bottom line is you don't know. Therefore, if you don't know, all you can do is go bay based upon your own examination. What you what you really what is insincere is to say that I will just follow everything that someone says, and I'll believe the things that they tell me. And whatever practice they ask me to do, I will do. Unless unless there's been some consistent results that an individual has gotten and those are the results, at least in the direction of what they're looking for, then it's based upon faith. And in order for something to be based in order for faith to be given, there have there has to be some tangible result that can allow someone to generate. If there's nothing happening and it's pure faith, that's up to the individual if they wish to go that path. That's a personal decision. But it isn't about should you listen to them or should you not. But what I can tell you is this, there isn't a single person that you'll meet in your life who does not prescribe. It will never happen. You can search the world up and down, go to every nation, every village of every country in the world, from the mountains to the seas to the rivers to the oceans to the forest to the jungle, whatever wherever you go. It's not gonna happen. Therefore, if one establishes for themselves, not by listening to me, but if they establish it for themselves, that prescriptions don't lead anyone anywhere, and then they are given prescription, then that's something that they have to decide for themselves if that is a path that resonates with them. It isn't you should or you should not and that's right and that's wrong. One has to use his own intelligence. One has to use his own capabilities of discrimination and deciphering, and weeding out and allowing in. If someone does not know about per which really almost no one does except for the 14 people who listen to me, then they don't even recognize that prescription. Don't in fact, that question ever even arises. The fact that how to is a road to nowhere is a vastly otherworldly and antithetical and entirely against its outer space. No one would even think to go there. Therefore, one reflexively and by default follows those. So that's what I have to say to you. I cannot tell you what you should do or not do, but those are things that that looking in that logical way through your own self may help to provide you with, the path that is most appropriate for you.

But in this age, like, for examples, an individual is aspiring to transform people, but not necessarily in a chaotic manner. So what what kind of path they should choose if we aspire to transform people, not in this mainstream way of pouring in lots of information, but necessarily in a spiritual way.

Or what does it allow that allows you to see the truth as what does it allow that allows you to the truth even when it's the person expects benevolence from you? Is that I don't care what people expect. I I'm not interested in teaching anyone, nor do I care if they get it or not, nor am I trying to be benevolent.

      "text": "Take a bell. My question is about transcending the mind. Throughout some of your discourses and your talks, you say something along the lines of the mind does not wish to die and how it'll fight to the death in order to preserve itself. Are you gonna ask me how? I'm asking you like, there's there's certain memories and thoughts that arise to where there's, like, a, like, being poked in the arm with a needle. There's an automatic flinching and automatic, identity, and whether it be guilt or shame or fear without any real context behind it. My question is, is there an underlining context behind these to where they need to be investigated, or is it simply come into an understanding that they're all lies and just empty attempts from the mind to survive? That's a that's a very big question. I think one first has to be in a position where they're able to understand, what a lie is and what truth is. And even things that sound that simple really are not. And the reason that they're not as simple is because one comes from a certain place. And the place that he comes from is a place of, years and years and years of conditioning. If he had come as a neutral person, then he would have entered zero. And therefore, at zero, he can see below him and he can see above him. But when he arrives at negative 4625, he doesn't know where zero is. I mean, he certainly doesn't know where plus two is. So because he arrives at negative 4,625, he comes as someone who can't even utter a word because he is not in a place to understand even the word the because he doesn't arrive at zero. So it's almost anything that that person asked. He is asking it from the place of negative 4,625. Therefore, he it is his desire to want to not be there that is his greatest asset. If he thinks he knows something and if he thinks that he even knows, a question to ask, he will fail because the question that he asks is a question that is born of his negative 4625",

      "text": "Hey. I had a question about, I guess, therapy. And I hear a lot of people talking about, they go through something bad, and it seems like their advice they get is to look at their, childhood or whatever. And it just kinda popped in my head like, you know, something good happens. I don't hear a lot of people saying, you know, you get a promotion or you get that job or the car or whatever, and it's like, well, let's look at your childhood. Didn't know if you had any thoughts on that. Or, So, psychologists, really don't know anything about them. Psychiatrist essentially just prescribe medic. A psychiatrist these days are basically psychopharmacology. Psychologists wanna talk about your childhood and they believe that the talking about things actually gets you somewhere, where it's just all swirling muddy water. So the life coaches, the gurus, the this coach, the that coach, the therapist, this and that. And and listen, I'm not saying someone's in a in a psychotic state and or is, you know, in a suicidal or homicidal place that they need Medicaid. I'm not talking about that. I mean, obviously, that needs intervention, be it medication or whatever it requires. That's fine. That's an emergency type situation where people who are really, you know, in catatonic states. I mean, those are different situations. But, you know, the idea of this therapy that I'm going to come to you and you're going to ask me what is my problem. Well, fear about something, let's say, and the therapist is gonna say, well, why do you feel fear? And and you're gonna say, well, I don't know. This thing squares me. Well, well, what do you think that can be done about that? And let's think of some strategies. Let's think of some solution. And next time that happens, maybe you can wait five seconds, and maybe you can take deep breaths, and maybe you can meditate, and maybe you can do x, y, and z. Maybe you can take, you know, do five jumping jacks and 16 sit ups. These things are these thing these things are juvenile. They they are not for serious people. And what you have in the world what you have in the world is a compendium and a mass populous of unserious and insincere individuals who have been conditioned to seek cosmetic clues. They have been taught to chase makeup and eye shine. So in every field, in every single field, you see makeup and eye shadow. That's all it is. It is swirling muddy water. So your instincts are correct. These things don't get anyone anywhere, but it doesn't mean that people should stop doing it largely because nobody really wants to get anywhere anyway. Therefore, those who give nothing and then those who look for nothing, it's a match made in heaven. That's awesome. Thank you. You don't know anything.",

      "text": "Hello, Kapil. Thank you. And I have a problem, and and that is that I'm constantly seeking some shard of of information, that I hope will will take me somewhere. And and I think the reason behind this is because although I understand that from a a logical level and I've you know, after a year, I I feel like I have decent understanding that instruction is is fragmented and and rarely takes you, where you wanna go if never. But there's there's the in these small instances, for example, in golf, not that I'm an excellent golfer by any means. I refuse to read or listen to instruction or coaches or anything. And, over time, my my handicap stayed the same. It it never changed. And then one day, I golfed with a friend who was better than myself, and he pointed out your you know, that's something that you've talked about. And he said you're swinging at the ball, and it it was very little. And then when I went and golfed the next day without him, shaved five off my handicap. And and he was right. Like, what he was saying was true, and and it made a difference. And I think because there's been small moments like that where I've I've heard some truth from somebody, and it helped, it keeps me on the hook. So I'm I'm constantly, like, day in and day out, almost twenty four seven, combing through information, searching for shards of truth, but it but it's exhausting. And it and it doesn't lead me to greatness. It's small, silly things. But and there's nothing, like, there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with anything. I mean, if it it once once again, I have said before, if it's something menial, it's prescriptions work fine. If you wanna learn how to tie your shoe, you can get a prescription for that. If you if you wanna know how to hammer a nail, you can get a prescription. Turn on a computer, you get a prescription for that. So someone told you that don't swing at the ball. Okay. Well, then that's that's fine. But if someone wants something substantial, if somebody wants something that is lasting, somebody wants something that is significant in the domain of life, in the domain of mind, in the domain of arriving at any semblance of permanence or consistency, or reproducibility, be it in life or their craft, sports business, whatever it may be, then prescriptions don't have the bandwidth for that. Prescriptions can take you, to the very, very, very minimal place. It's like a minimum wage type. You can be taught how to flip a burger. You know, so there there is utility for it, but everything that I talk about is from a different place. Anyone who comes to my domain has to understand from the very outset things that I talk about are from the level of ultimate legend, world class, becoming a master of life, sports, business, whatever it is. So I come from there. And because I live in that domain, then everything that I say is colored by my coming from there. I don't come from the tire shoe and turn on the computer and hammer a nail. And if if someone does come from there, then it would make sense why they would talk about prescriptions. The problem is that everyone's talking about whether it's world whether they're gonna get you to world class or hammer a nail. So, in the world today, wherever you go, there's grass and pavement. Wherever you go, anywhere you go in the world, there's grass and pavement. So or dirt or rocks or gravel. K? It's the same way with prescriptions. They're literally that literally is all there is. There's not there's not this part of the world who prescribes and this part of the world who doesn't. There's not these coaches who prescribed and these types of coaches who don't. There is no separate. Every last one Buddha prescribed. I mean, there's nobody who doesn't not only doesn't not do it, there's nobody whose even foundation isn't based upon. It isn't a tool. That's the only tool they have. So if you went to every so called coach and took away their prescriptions, they'd be mum. They had nothing to do. They didn't tell them nothing to say. Nothing. Zero. It would be over. Their career would be finished. Nothing would exist. And that tells you just how dependent and just how saturated and just how ubiquitous prescriptions are in the world. And in fact, they are the only thing that exists in the world. In every field, from top to bottom, from the highest levels to the lowest level, from the Far East to the Far West, there was no one, not a single person. Now you have these copycat accounts who copy my work, basically. It's basically plagiarism that have shown up, and they talk on their site. I will I it's not about prescriptions. I'm not going to prescribe to you. So you have these things popping up left and right. I've been informed of all these websites people are creating and coaching services they are creating, and they're talking about no prescriptions. Obviously, they're gonna fold because they had no there's there isn't the, it's like taking a plant and then taking it from it's like taking a palm from a tropical climate and then replanting it in Alaska. You can do it. It's not gonna last because there's no foundation. There's no lifelong devotion. There's no once you once you till away the first quarter inch of soil, there's nothing. So that's what you have that's what you have found. And so there's nothing wrong with what you're saying. I learned a tip, and the tip helped. Sure. Tips can help. Are they gonna take you somewhere? No. But maybe it helps you to some degree, and and you got happy by the way in which it helps you, and that's that's perfectly fine. I didn't say prescriptions don't help. I have consistently said they help with menial things, but but the message is often lost because it is a default setting that one should understand when they enter my domain that everything that I say is is from the level of world class and greatness and legendary status and mastery. And therefore, if that isn't understood, then the one is going to say, well, I found a tip and the tip helped me. And finally, it didn't last, but it helped me some. Is there something wrong what's wrong with that? And the answer is nothing. But I'm not talking about tying shoes, turning on computers, and hammering nails. And and my question isn't that, that helped me. So is it fine if I pursue it? Like, my No. That's not your question. Your question is because the tip because the tip did help you, that keeps you addicted to looking for more tips which might help you. I know your question. I understand.",

I wanna search you, and I don't wanna if I'm wrong, I apologize, but I wanna search you to say that when you make a change, you always change back, so it's not permanent. I'm just wondering why that is. Why do I do why what makes a change permanent? Well, because that that's that's basically the that's basically the foundation of self help and self development, because everything is based upon cosmetics. So if the if the root of something is not affected, then a thing will change back. Just because you bend it doesn't mean it won't bend back. So everything is done by force. Everything is done by, cosmetic behavioral changes. Say this, don't say that. Change your tone, change this. And therefore, because the root of the matter is never even sniffed, then the change back is inevitable. And that's why self help, self development, spirituality, that entire industry is completely baseless. It has no foundation. It should have already crumbled. And the only reason it happened it it hasn't is because people are looking for cosmesis, and they don't know anything other than prescriptions. May I ask a following question?",

Could you give an example of how something would be at the root? If if someone did do something at the root, how what what it would be to change? Well, what what don't you understand about it being cosmetic? No. That I do understand, but I I wonder if there's an example of something chain being changed at the room. Well, it's the true essence of things, the true cause of some no one knows the cause of anything because they don't they don't they don't spend years investigating. Everyone's basically just a cosmetic peddler. Everyone pedals every industry from medicine, engineering, But so I'm saying but is there are there ever times when it's not that and No. It's not. Okay. So so It's it's it's it's never not that. The only way the only way it is not that if is if it comes from a place of truth, which doesn't exist in the world. Oh, okay. So you're saying it would doesn't exist. So are you saying that's impossible or just doesn't happen? No. I'm not saying it's I'm not saying it's impossible. I do it all the time. You do what all the time? I don't know what you don't understand. I don't know what you do all the time. Are you new here? Yeah. Okay. So there's nothing that I can say to you that will satisfactorily explain to you what it is that I do. I don't even know what so maybe you'll get a better understanding of what it is and if it actually resonates with you or not. Well, you were saying I do it all the time in response to I forget exactly what I said. I said, you know, some I said it's a possibility. It's about arriving at the truth about Okay. So you you feel that you arrive at the truth at all? I don't feel anything. I just do. Okay. So you do arrive at the truth. Does that mean that you have done changes that are permanent? Sure. Of course. So can you give give an example of that? That's what I'm asking. No. I can't give you an example of that. Do you know why? Why? Because you won't understand it. Okay. And then if I say hang on. Don't know if that's that's the biggest topic. Question. You you asked the question. No. You asked the question. I know you were No. So maybe is it possible? You're gonna let me respond, or you want me to just hang up on you? I don't give a fuck. It's up to whatever you wanna do. But so can you give an example? And just maybe I'll understand it, maybe I won't. The human being, in order to understand even an example of truth, has to have self vetted, has to have arrived at some basic foundational level of understanding that is beyond the prescriptive notion that society pedals. If they have not moved past the minus 4,565 I was talking about earlier, that any example that I give will only raise therefore, they're not ready to ask that question because they're not ready to understand it, And it has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence. It has to do with the conditioning being so deep, they can only hear the things that they are used to hearing, and they can only hear it in the context that they had been told it in before.

And there is no way If you if you knock on 70,000,000 doors for your entire life, when you go to the 70,000,000 in first they're you you're not and no reasonable per whatever suspect the 70,000,000 in first one is going to be an a reality that is basically opposite and completely contrary to even gravity moves in the opposite, to the first 70,000,000. No one no one that thought would never arise because they've never been to that kind of door before. So if someone has been here for a while, they begin to get that inkling, but oftentimes, it doesn't hit home. So the notion that you brought is the idea of fast tracking, accelerating, hurry it up. That's just one of 500,000,000,000 things that you picked up from the world, and they are relevant in they are relevant in the places that you have been, which is the world. Those things have relevance, they don't work, but they have relevance there. They that lingo, that notion, that concept, that idea, all of the notions, concepts, principles, ideas, that people have, they pick them up from the world. Therefore, they they know what others are talking about when they say that. So when they come into this domain, they have to shed everything. None of those things will work here. There there's no five ways. There's no acceleration. Even the simplest, most sacred cow type thing that they have known in the world, They don't work here. They don't work in the domain of they only they don't even work in anywhere, but they have some they are recognizable. The lingo is in play in the world of prescription in the world at large. And so when someone comes to the domain of truth, they can't bring that baggage. None of it will work. It isn't that they're wrong for doing so, that they're bad for doing so. It's just you cannot bring a key which doesn't work. Doesn't work here. And that's why most have a real tough time with it because that's the only thing they've ever known. Those are the only tools and lingos and notion, concepts, ideas, principles. That's all they know. So, therefore, what else is one going to say and use and and what lens is he going to see through other than the one that he has been given? So one literally has to find a new lens. One has to now that can't be done in the beginning. That's that's done through repeated failure when they recognize that, wait a minute. All these things that I thought were true, they don't work here. They never even work there, but they don't work here. So that's a that's that's using, what you said as a platform to make a more fundamental point using your question as an entry point your case, it was, you know, accelerate the process, so to speak. Somebody else might be something else. But all of those notions, they all come from a place of, chasing and and the world and prescription and how to's. Those are all things that are lie. That's why they don't work here. Thank you. I, thank you for inviting me to the stage.",

You have, referenced, great masters and warriors of the past, as your inspiration. Yet you have given us insights that, we may not find much truth in their teachings. Example, Buddha taught the middle path, but he didn't follow it. So I wonder in what form did the did did their inspiration come to you? Like, how were you able to see the truth in what they were saying? Or Well, I think someone like, you know, Buddha I think, you know, Buddha, Jesus, these the the life devotion, the, these people, they wanted the real, true thing. They they didn't want the cosmetic. They wanted all of it. They wanted the ultimate. They became ultimate. And when Buddha first went into the forest, who did he wanna cross? He came across the aesthetics. And what did they do? What everybody does. They prescribed. Sit down, meditate under a tree, eat one grain of rice, drink your own urine, sit there for twenty hours a day, rain or shine. But what happened? He became on the verge of death and didn't get anywhere. And that's what he said. I am no longer I have done all these people's, what the people have asked me to do. And yet after all of these years of doing all of these things, I am no closer to wisdom than I was when I left my father's house. If you wanna read about the Buddha, don't read his stupid Four Noble Truths of Eightfold. That's garbage. Doesn't go anywhere. Read that. No one looks at that. As usual, humans, because society teaches them a lie, humans missed the point. There was what people need to learn. Not he sat under a tree and, how long he meditated. That's stupid. That wasn't what causes enlightenment. What if there's a teaching point in Buddha's story, it is the seven years that he practiced prescriptions and by his own admission, got nowhere and therefore",

My question is, I'm at a point where I've tend to I read your discourse that you released maybe a few days ago or so. It was a band interview. I'm calling the revolution. And in this discourse, the interviewer said something like their life on the outside is is completely the same, but on the inside, things are different. And when I read that, it resonated with me because it kind of explained it kind of explained where I'm at in my life and how your work has affected me. So my question is, it bugged me why I couldn't figure out. I wasn't sure whether the truth was actually taking an effect on me or it was some kind of illusion. So my question is, does it even matter in the first place? Am I just just looking for approval some approval that will, you know, have no effect or provide me nothing? So that's my question. I don't quite understand the Okay. So, I guess it's does to be sure, like, if the truth is having an effect on me, I've noticed that I feel that certain anxieties and things of that nature that I used to feel, certain things that used to arise don't arise. And is it futile to be sure, to be actually sure if doubt arises? Does doubt if a doubt arises, does that have any does that matter at all? Doubt about what? Doubt about, doubt about whether truth is actually having an effect on me. Well, did you not just say that things that you used to feel that you don't feel anymore? Right. I did. But what happened, even though I see these things, I'm still enticed by them. I'm still enticed by society in ways. I wanna walk outside. When I go to my job, I I lift my head up and I act a certain way. And even though I've read truth intellectually, maybe it's not in my bones like the way you say. Maybe it's I'm sort of almost there. I'm on the way. But Yeah. I I I think I the answer to your question is yes. I mean, that's a chase to see you know, to quietly to quietly examine the effect something is having is, is actually wise to see what effect it's having. But beyond that, it becomes a chase because, once again, these are very similar to what the person asked earlier about. I forgot what word he used to to to accelerate sort of the progress. There there's, you know, there's this chase. That's saying you just you just bringing the chase from the world towards truth and say hurry up already. How come it's how come I'm still feeling this and that? So the answer is yes. That is superfluous. Hello.",

I mean, the truth is in the moment, I mean, as I understood it, that this is the moment that, shouldn't be left, because, once But but you you have to be very careful with your words. I never said anything about should or should not anything. I should never I never said that you should stay in the moment. I never said that, truth is in the moment and that you this is the moment that you should never leave. Like, you can interpret it whatever way you want, but it's you have to be very careful with your words. Once again, you cannot bring the garbage of society into here. I did not say that you should do anything or shouldn't do anything or be in the moment because that's all garbage. And that's why I have to say something because that really is garbage, and I would never say that. Right, Kapil. No. So it's my own experience as well. When I'm in the moment, I feel the calmness of it. But but then as soon as I start planning for the future, this is where I find myself leaving this moment and the restlessness comes in. Right? Yeah. You're too interested you're too interested in the moment. It's this notion that is plaguing you. And that being that interested in the moment, all you're gonna do your question basically is going to, well, when I'm planning, I get out of the moment. So how do I get back into the moment? That's where you're going. Those things, that's once again, that's garbage. There's no way you can get into the moment. It's stupid. It's idiotic. It's it's moronic. Go ahead. Try. Try all your life. Get into the moment. That's just more nonsensical idiotic garbage theoretical impractical crap. The monkey mind and get into the moment. It doesn't work. You can meditate till the cows come home. You can mind fool your life away. There's no you cannot get into the moment by by the the that's not how it works. So these these questions are it's the same thing about people ask me questions about flow. When I'm in flow, I just feel flow flow flow. Wonderful. Flow is more intellectual nonsense. How do I get into flow and I'm back in the I'm out of the flow. How do I get back into the flow? I mean, these questions the people who ask these questions, my answer to them, my honest answer to them is read through my work. That's my honest answer.

I don't have, much work commitments. I've left the city. When I'm in the city, I feel distracted and bombarded. But but that's still very cosmetic.

Things don't work that way. Because as soon as as soon as you enter back into, your regular life, you will snap back. And quite honestly, even if you were to stay in the permanent vacay, the environment would lose its effect. The only reason it has any effect at all is because there's a stark contrast between it and what you just came from. When that becomes your new norm, you'll look for a new vacation to get away from that. So the answer is yes. That's cosmetic. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
